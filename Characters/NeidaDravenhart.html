            <p>Neida Dravenhart was born beneath the shadow of Ashspire, a volcanic peak whispered to house the last dragons of the old world.</p>
            <p>As a child, she wandered too far and vanished into the mountains—returning days later with seared skin, dragon-blooded eyes, and a name no longer forgotten.</p>
            <p>She trained as a blademaster, wielding flame as both weapon and will, and hunted the very beasts whose fire had once nearly ended her.</p>
            <p>But when the Dragon King awakened and scorched the southern realms, it was Neida who challenged him in the sky—and fell with him into the sea of flame.</p>
            <p>She rose again in firelight, no longer mortal, her soul fused with dragonkind and crowned in ash and gold.</p>
            <p>Now called the Flame God, Neida Dravenhart reigns from the Ember Seat, feared by tyrants and worshiped by those who warm their hands beside her fire.</p>
